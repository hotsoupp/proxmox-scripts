# Proxmox-Scripts

Welcome to Proxmox-Scripts! This repository is a collection of scripts aimed at simplifying the management of Proxmox containers (LXC).

## Scripts

This repository contains two scripts for installing the Prometheus node exporter on LXC containers in a Proxmox environment. The following is a brief overview of the scripts available:

- [`lxc-node-exporter-full.sh`]([./lxc-node-exporter-full.sh](https://github.com/hotsoupp/proxmox-scripts/tree/main/lxc-node-exporter)): This script automatically installs the node exporter on all LXC containers in a Proxmox environment.
- [`lxc-node-exporter-manual.sh`]([./lxc-node-exporter-manual.sh](https://github.com/hotsoupp/proxmox-scripts/tree/main/lxc-node-exporter)): This script prompts the user to select which LXC containers to install the node exporter on. It is useful for selectively installing the node exporter on specific containers.

## How to Use

To use these scripts, simply clone this repository to your Proxmox node and run the script(s). 

Before executing the scripts, make sure to review the configuration settings and customize them as needed.
